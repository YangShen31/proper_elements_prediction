# Proper Element Prediction

### Setup
Download `MPCORB.DAT.gz` and `proper_catalog24.dat.gz` from [boulder.swri.edu/~davidn/Proper24](https://www2.boulder.swri.edu/~davidn/Proper24/) and place the uncompressed files in `data/`

### Family Identification Evaluation
Download family tables from [ast.nesvorny.families_V2_0/data/families_2024](https://sbnarchive.psi.edu/pds4/non_mission/ast.nesvorny.families_V2_0/data/families_2024/). For d values thresholds, please refer to Table 3 to 7 from [Nesvorny24](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4365/ad675c). To generate the histogram for precision and percentage detected across different families from `model_testing_plots_generation.ipynb`, download the Table 3 to 7 and convert them into csv file.
